!Do you know!

Human errors can lead to important data being leaked online. For example, Nissan source code leaked online after Git repo misconfiguration (see https://www.zdnet.com/article/nissan-source-code-leaked-online-after-git-repo-misconfiguration/)

You can even look at the history of a file to reveal secrets.
